PokeBattle is a re-incarneted 'Tekken' battle game based on the October coding Cohort at Makers Academy. The duration of this project was for a week.

## How To Use:



## Approach:



## MVP:

It was vital for us to create an MVP as we had to pinpoint what made our game unique. This was
our starting point/goal for building the project.

```
As a user,
So I can be engaged with the battle game,
I would like to see two characters on the screen
```

```
As a user,
So I can be start playing the battle game,
I would like to attack a player (and see a reaction)
```

```
As a user,
So I can be start playing the battle game,
I would like the attacked player to receive damage to their health bar  
```

## Other User Stories (That were accomplished):

Throughout the week, we branched off into accomplishing the following user stories. Although we
brainstormed many, these are the ones that were acheived during the week.
